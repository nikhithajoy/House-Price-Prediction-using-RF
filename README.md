# Predicting House Sale Prices using Random Forest Regression

This GitHub project focuses on predicting house sale prices using a Random Forest regression model. The project is based on a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) that provides a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can estimate the final price of each house based on its features.

Key Features:

1. Random Forest Regression: The project utilizes the Random Forest regression algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.

2. Comprehensive Feature Set: The dataset offers an extensive range of 79 explanatory variables, covering almost every aspect of residential homes.

3. Data Preprocessing: The project involves thorough data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and, encoding categorical variables, to ensure the data is ready for modeling.

4. Model Training and Evaluation: The Random Forest model is trained on the preprocessed data using appropriate training and validation techniques. The model's performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as R-squared.

5. Documentation and Code: The GitHub repository contains detailed documentation and well-organized code, explaining the steps involved in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This ensures clarity and reproducibility of the project.
